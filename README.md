<p style="text-align:center; bottom: 4; font-size: 50px">I like to do some art and make personal designed artistry in my free time. 
I have been told to start selling my art and I thought I would give it a shot. I do things like spray paint art, hydro dipped shoes/controllers, carpenter bee traps,
and animal food bowl stands. Hope you like what you see and are interested in buying something!!
